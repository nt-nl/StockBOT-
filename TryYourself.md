Hi! to try this out yourself (the easy way), you will need to have:

1. Discord
2. Replit account
3. Your own Discord server

Firstly, go over to (https://discord.com/developers/) and login. Then you will create your own Application/Bot, name it whatever you want!

Then hit reset token if you aren't sure of your current token and copy and paste it into a notepad file <---

After that, you will need to get your invite link with the appropriate permissions, for ease, here is a link you may use:

https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[INSERT YOUR CLIENT ID HERE]&scope=bot&permissions=137439439872

You will need to replace a portion of that link marked with a very subtle "[INSERT YOUR CLIENT ID HERE]"

you can get your clientID at this part of the website: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1378f7c5-0889-4f13-bda5-1300390f7713)

After this, you can paste the link into your browser and add the bot to your selected server.



We will then go over to replit and paste the code for the bot over to a new repl (use the Python template)

We will now create a secret for replit for your token so that no one else looking at your project can see it!

After putting in your token that you had after pressing reset token


We will replace some of the code so that it works well with replit.
